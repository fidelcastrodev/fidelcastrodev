# Variable declarations in Pyrustlang
# Demonstrates Python-like syntax with Rust-inspired type annotations

# Immutable variable (Rust-inspired)
let x: i32 = 42
print(x)

# Mutable variable (Rust-inspired)
let mut y: i32 = 10
print(y)
y = 20
print(y)

# Type inference (Python-like)
let name = "Alice"
print(name)

# Different types
let pi: f64 = 3.14159
print(pi)

let is_active: bool = true
print(is_active)
